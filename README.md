# Clairctl Docker Container

Alpine-based container to run clairctl commands.  Adds your .clairctl.yml file to the container at /root/clairctl.yml

Comes with a helm chart that will allow you to run this alongside clair in a k8s cluster.  It will create a webpage where you can view all of your container reports.
